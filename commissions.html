        <h2>Guidelines</h2>

        <p>Communicate with me at my email (necropocene@gmail.com) for any specific questions or quotes for what a piece
            would cost. If you have a specific style in mind feel free to show me one of my previous works or another
            reference. For felting commissions let me know if you would like the piece to be fully wool or include clay
            sculpting or other accessories.</p>
